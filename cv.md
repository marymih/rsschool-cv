## About me
I worked at a large online store for five years in two positions: content manager and business analyst. This experience provided me with an in-depth understanding of the company's internal business and development processes. My interest in front-end development led me to study this field.

My strengths include:
* Sociability
* Responsibility
* Attention to details
## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Git
## Code example
```
function moveZeros(arr) {
  let newLength = arr.length;
  for (i=0; i < newLength; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      arr.push(0);
      arr.splice(i, 1);
      newLength--;
      i--;
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
```
